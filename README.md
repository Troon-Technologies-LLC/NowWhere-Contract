## Summary of NowWhereContract

NowWhereContract contract is used to release or sell non-fungible tokens for there users. In NowWhereContract, we are managing drops. Drop is like an event, which has start and end dates with the NFT template/s, which will be for sale in that drop.
We can create a Drop by providing a unique drop-id, start and end dates and template/s. To purchase a Drop users can use off-chain Payment method(Fiat) supported by the NowWhere platform or Flow Tokens too. There is multisignature functionality for Flow payment to add user signature for payment withdraw and admin signature for confirmation of user payment and purchasing of a Drop. As new brands and businesses begin to take advantage of this technology you will see even more drops.
